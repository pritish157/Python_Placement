# # Try these 10 questions:

# # Take two numbers from user and swap them using + and - (without 3rd variable).
# a = int(input("enter num.1 : "))
# b = int(input("enter num.2 : "))
# a = a+b
# b = a-b
# a = a-b
# print(a,b)
# # Swap two numbers without third variable


# print("Before swap: a =", a, ", b =", b)
# # Method 2: Using XOR (bitwise)

# a = a ^ b   # a = 5 ^ 10
# b = a ^ b   # b = (5 ^ 10) ^ 10 = 5
# a = a ^ b   # a = (5 ^ 10) ^ 5 = 10

# print("After swap (Method 2): a =", a, ", b =", b)

# # Method 3: Python shortcut
# a, b = b, a
# print("After swap (Method 3): a =", a, ", b =", b)

# Take a number and check if itâ€™s odd/even using bitwise &.
# a = int(input("enter a number"))
# if(a & 1 ==0):
#     print("even")
# else:
#     print("odd")
